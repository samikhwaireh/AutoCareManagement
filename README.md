## 1. Features

The AutoCare System offers the following key features:

- Customer Management: Allows auto care centers to create and manage customer profiles, including contact information, vehicle details, and service history.
- Service Records: Enables the creation and management of service records for each customer, including details such as service type, date, and cost.
- Item Inventory Management: Provides functionality to track and manage items in the auto care center's inventory, including item details, quantity, and pricing.
- Search Functionality: Allows users to search for customers, service records, and items using various criteria.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Implements user authentication and role-based authorization to ensure secure access to the system's features and data.

## 2. Architecture

The AutoCare System follows a layered architecture to ensure modularity, separation of concerns, and code reusability. The key architectural layers are:

- Presentation Layer: This layer handles the user interface components and user interactions. It consists of the web-based frontend implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Application Layer: The application layer contains the business logic and orchestrates the flow of data between the presentation layer and the data access layer. It encapsulates use cases, service classes, and application-specific business rules.

- Data Access Layer: The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It utilizes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework, such as Dapper, to simplify database operations and ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

- Database: The database layer consists of a SQL Server database that stores customer information, service records, and item inventory data. It is designed using appropriate tables, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity.

## 3. Technologies Used

The AutoCare System is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- .NET 7: The latest version of the .NET framework is used for developing the backend application logic and APIs.

- ASP.NET Core: ASP.NET Core is used to build the web application, handle HTTP requests, and provide RESTful APIs.

- Dapper: Dapper is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for database interactions, providing fast and efficient data access.

- SQL Server: SQL Server is used as the database management system to store and retrieve application data.

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: These standard web technologies are used for developing the frontend user interface.

- Git/GitHub: Git version control system and GitHub platform are utilized for source code management and collaboration.

## 4. Installation and Setup

To set up the AutoCare System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:
git clone <repository_url>

2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Configure the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file with your SQL Server details.

4. Build the solution to restore the NuGet packages and compile the code.

5. Run the database migration to create the necessary tables in the SQL Server database. You can use the Entity Framework Core CLI or the provided migration script.

6. Start the application. The web application will launch in your default web browser.

## 5. Usage Guide
